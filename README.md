# Custom_enumberables
This project was designed to reinforce blocks, procs, and lambdas.

I went ahead and only posted my cleaned up version for this project instead
of creating a large spec test folder as I don't see how it's necessary.

This was a bit confusing for me initially, but once I was able to get
a few tests working, it made more sense. I still don't feel totally comfortable
with this, but will continue to rework it as needed.
